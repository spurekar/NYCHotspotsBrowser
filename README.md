NYCHotspots
===========

So many times I need a place to sit down and check email / do work while on the run, but there doesn't seem to be a way more straightforward than using Yelp to get this data. I found a mapping of New York City's wifi hotspots on the NYC Open Data site, and have decided to create an interactive map of wifi areas. 

Users will enter in an address (or just browse the map) to locate places closest to them. They will also have the ability to filter hotspots based on price (free or fee-based), as well as enter new hotspots to the map (shown as unverified).

Currently, I am only using data from New York City.

I will make this app publicly available when it is finished!
